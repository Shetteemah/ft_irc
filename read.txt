Now our irc is upgraded to be a server
For now use just (./irc <port>) to execute it
1 - We can connect many clients and listen to them at the same time 
	+ you guys can test it by tapping "nc 127.0.0.1 <port>"
	+ nc is a client that we already have in our env and we can use it for testing
	+ if you want to test with to many client using this line : just split terminal
2 - we can give a name for each client : try to write anything from the client side 
	and you will have a msg to set the name.
3 - KICK should work now(can be fixed after)
4 - PRIVMSG is also there ,for now we can just send msgs between clients by using their names
	+ send this from the client to test "/PRIVMSG <target_name> <MSG>"
		dont forget to have at least 2 clients with names before testing it
NOTE : the most lines have a comment to explain their work, if something was not clear mention it on slack group

UPDATE!!!!  --> 11/06
1 - We should execute with (./irc <port> <password>)
2 - a CLient must Log using the same password in Server, Also should fill Username + nickname Before get connected to the server
3 - Now JOIN should Create a Channel (of course it dosn't work probably)
	+ Test line : /JOIN <channel_name> <blabla>
	+ blabla thing just to avoid a newline inside channel_name(i will fixed after, i should find other way to read)
	+ when you try to create a channel for the first you should fill some info (limit should be only numbers)
	+ if a channel is already created before it will show the info of channel
For now a Client can't really join the channel or use it to send a MSG(i start working on it, and i will finish it later)


UPDATE!!!!  --> 13/06
1 - Commands "/KICK" and "/TOPIC" works as we need(check the CMDs_Doc.md to see how the commands should be tested)
2 - KICK command can be used just by the client who creat the Channel(when we make /MODE then we can transfer the admin_priv to another client)
3 - TOPIC command print the Topic_string if there is no option with (if there is something after it will be considered as the new Topic)

================== Shettima =============================================

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. I added a new include header #include <vector>.

2. Created and broke some parts of the main into individual functions:
		a. 'error' function for printing error messages and exiting the program.

		b. 'searchByUsername' function for searching for a client based on their username.

		c. 'setNonBlocking' function for setting a socket to non-blocking mode.

		d. 'readFromSocket' function for reading data from a socket into a buffer.

		e. 'writeToSocket' function for writting data from a buffer to a socket.

		f. 'processReceivedData' function for processing the received data from a client.
