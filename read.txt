Now our irc is upgraded to be a server
For now use just (./irc <port>) to execute it
1 - We can connect many clients and listen to them at the same time 
	+ you guys can test it by tapping "nc 127.0.0.1 <port>"
	+ nc is a client that we already have in our env and we can use it for testing
	+ if you want to test with to many client using this line : just split terminal
2 - we can give a name for each client : try to write anything from the client side 
	and you will have a msg to set the name.
3 - KICK should work now(can be fixed after)
4 - PRIVMSG is also there ,for now we can just send msgs between clients by using their names
	+ send this from the client to test "/PRIVMSG <target_name> <MSG>"
		dont forget to have at least 2 clients with names before testing it
NOTE : the most lines have a comment to explain their work, if something was not clear mention it on slack group

UPDATE!!!!  --> 11/06
1 - We should execute with (./irc <port> <password>)
2 - a CLient must Log using the same password in Server, Also should fill Username + nickname Before get connected to the server
3 - Now JOIN should Create a Channel (of course it dosn't work probably)
	+ Test line : /JOIN <channel_name> <blabla>
	+ blabla thing just to avoid a newline inside channel_name(i will fixed after, i should find other way to read)
	+ when you try to create a channel for the first you should fill some info (limit should be only numbers)
	+ if a channel is already created before it will show the info of channel
For now a Client can't really join the channel or use it to send a MSG(i start working on it, and i will finish it later)
